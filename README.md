# MyPEViewer
A simple tool to analyze exe file and calculate RVA to RAW

#### Motive

​	During this period I have been focused on reverse engineering,but to analyze PE file header 

always troubles me with its hex code and anti-human complexity.Then I try to find an handy 

PEViewer programs in website,but they are either heavy or non-functional.So I cost some time 

to output my own PEViewer,except to show the structure in PE header,the html-based program

provide RVA to RAW calculator,which is very convenient  for reverse engineers.

#### Instructions

Just follow these steps:

​	1.Open the html file;

​	2.Chose an exe file you want to analyze.If the file is large it may cost respectively long time.

​	3.Input the RVA and click "GO" button to get RAW.
